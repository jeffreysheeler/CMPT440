Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. When I run the program
  it gives this:
--
$ java driverDFA 
gncgwng
That is a solution!
--
  which is the correct answer; however, it is not in the correct format. Your
  program should work as follows:
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
That is a solution.
--
  the differences are that it takes input as arguments from command line, and
  also it should end with . instead of !


Style:

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Good block comments

- Both files have incorrect headers. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}

- You are using TABs!!!

- Code (or comments) go beyond 100 characters. Keep lines of code short.
  Optimally 80 characters, but no more than 100.


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.

- Your program is supposed to run by taking input as an argument in command
  line, as follows (from the handout):
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng 
--
  but your program is making me do this
--
$ java driverDFA
gncgwng
--
  which is not what you were asked to do in the handout.



CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- Next time, include a more meaningful description of the states. What does it
  mean to be in that state, for example.
